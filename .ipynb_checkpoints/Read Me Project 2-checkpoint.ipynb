    "In this project I am using Aimes housing data to predict sales prices of homes in Aimes, Iowa. I recieved information on 81 features, including sale price, about 2,051 homes in Aimes, Iowa. I created models on this data and used my model to make sale price predictions for houses where I know all the same features except Sale Price. In this project I made 4 different models, one of which is interative and fully adjustble in realtime. My root mean squared error so far on my top model's predictions, when applied to unseen data, is 23082.1507 dollars. This shows that the average magnitude of error on sale price for my best model so far is 23082.1507 dollars. "

    "Furthermore predictions of sale price by my model can be used to figure out if a home is being sold above or below market value. For example, if a home is found on the market that is listed significantly below the predicted sale sale price, this home is likely a great value purchase. Conversely, if a home is listed significantly above the predicted sale value, this home is likely above market value. In this way, the model can help individuals make smarter and more informed home purchases. Additionally, this model can help homeowners learn what is an appropriate value to list as the sale price of their home. \n",

    "Finally, I used my original linear model to find the following coeficients for neighboorhood and its corelation to sale price.  This list tells you which neighboorhoods have a possitive and negative correlation to sale price as predicted by my model. The interpretation of these coeficients is that, all else being equal, being in the neighborhood will raise or lower the sale price of the home by the dollar value of the associeted Coefficient. \n",
